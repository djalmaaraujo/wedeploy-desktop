# WEDEPLOY NO LONGER EXISTS. FEEL FREE TO USE THE APP AS ANOTHER DESKTOP APP.

![Banner](banner.png?raw=true)

Keep posted on all activites from your projects and services. Monitor your plan usage and access services logs super fast.

**This is not an official application and it's basically a proof of concept.**

## Usage

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/djalmaaraujo/wedeploy-desktop/releases).


## Getting Started
Simply clone down this reposity, install dependencies, and get started on your application.

The use of the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is **strongly** recommended, as opposed to using `npm`.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# run application in development mode
yarn dev

# compile source code and create webpack output
yarn compile

# `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
yarn dist

# `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
yarn dist:dir
```

## Caught a bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the app: `yarn start`

To make sure that your code works in the bundled application, you can generate the binaries like this:

```bash
yarn dist
```

Check `./dist` folder for installers.
